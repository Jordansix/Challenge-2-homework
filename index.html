                <p>
                    My name is Jordan Sandoval Victoria, I am 21 years old. I love cooking, creating music, mixing music, playing tennis and reading books. I first expierenced passion within my music. At 15 years old I started rapping and even did a couple shows while I was in highschool. After expierencing this strong passion for the first time I knew I had to get into a career path that made me feel the same passion. So I got into coding and found that passion once more. I am learning to code so I can better my future goals and better the future for companys and businesses around the world.
